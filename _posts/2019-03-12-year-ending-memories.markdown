We didn’t cross new destinations off our list this year thanks to the birth of my son. However, in the last few months, we have been flying ever higher. Caring for him has been a brand new journey all of its own. When he lights up with a smile, most things pale in comparison to it. The innocence of a child, the way his mere presence makes us cross question all of our own ways, his ability to light up so many other lives and the special warmth that you feel when you hold him close to your heart are just some of the new experiences I have had this year. The most important one though is how much one appreciates one’s own parents when you become one. Unconditional love is something I would never have understood until I became a parent myself.
