He walked along the footpath narrowly avoiding a cyclist who had chosen to escape the traffic on the road and hoist his bicycle onto the footpath. He was lucky the footpath was too high for a motor cyclist to make it up there. Avoiding the spittle and the general detritus as he made this journey every single day was what kept him from boredom. The arrival of a small heap of garbage signalled the start of the bridge.

The sun was just beginning to set and the sky today looked spectacular with streaks of various colours running through it. He paused for a few moments. This was a rare treat. The dust, the smoke and the incessant honking sounds faded away. As he continued to looks at the colours they seemed to shimmer. The colors began to part away from the center. A blinding circle of light began to show through it. His thoughts momentarily went back to the cartoon shows he used to watch back in his childhood. When strange creatures emerged from portals through the sky and heroes were called upon to defend earth from the evil above. He woke up to find himself lying flat on the ground. A small crowd had gathered around him. A few muffled voices reached his ears. He woke with a start.

Had he blacked out. He heard a faint buzzing sound that felt like it was coming from within him. It turned out to be a fly. It seemed like he was ok. He looked up again at the sky. The colours had faded away. All that was left of the sun was a tiny wisp of orange light. He heard someone asking, "Are you ok?" He was too dazed to respond. He started walking towards home.

What had just happened? He looked at his watch. It showed 7 A.M. What? He tapped his watch. Still 7 AM. It looked scratch free, but he assumed that the watch must have been damaged when he fell down. He needed to get away from the chaos. Time to move. 

As soon as he got home he headed straight to bed. He was asleep within a few minutes. As his eyes flickered sensed brightness in the room. How could it be. It meant he had slept for 12 hours straight. He couldn't remember the last time he ever slept for more than 7 hours at a stretch.

It seemed unusually quiet for a morning. He could only hear the dogs barking. He walked out of the room and into his balcony. The streets were empty. It looked like a curfew was in effect. This was a üçì
